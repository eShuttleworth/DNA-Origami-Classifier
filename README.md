## Characterizing Hinges
### Created at Hack OHI/O 2016

### Team Members (in no particular order):

This is a classifier for DNA Origami Hinges written in Python with Scikit-Learn.
Note, this is currently Python 2.x ONLY
However, it shouldn't be terribly difficult to port

# Dependencies: 
* Scikit-learn
* boto3 - AWS Python SDK to be able to use callAwsModels.py

# Windows Dependencies Installation:
* Use PIP to install the following .whl files (Note, I used the '-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64' versions)
