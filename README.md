# DNA Origami Nanostructures
## Characterizing Hinges
### Forked from project created at Hack OHI/O 2016

### Original Team Members (in no particular order):
* Thomas Matlak

This is a classifier for DNA Origami Hinges written in Python with Scikit-Learn.
Note, this is currently Python 2.x ONLY
However, it shouldn't be terribly difficult to port

### Some current Dependencies: 
* Scikit-learn
* boto3 - AWS Python SDK to be able to use callAwsModels.py

### Windows Dependencies Installation:
* Use PIP to install the following .whl files (Note, I used the '-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64' versions)

### Classifier was almost entirely written by Edwin, the AWS converter was entierely Thomas's. All data is from Josh.
